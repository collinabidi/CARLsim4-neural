Algorithm 1: Forward and Backward Propagation
//Forward propagation
for l=1:layers do
	for c=1:layer(l).cores do
		Calculate core binary crossbar connections c_i_j and effective weights
		w_i_j
	end for
end for
Estimate log loss in last layer
//Backpropagation
for l=1:layers do
	for c=1:layers(l).cores do
		Calculate gradiants using c_i_j
		Update c_i_j^sh using estimated gradients
	end for
end for
